            <p>Lately the realty seems like a dream, it’s hard to escape all the news and sometimes hard to deal with what is happening, whether that’s layoffs, people getting sick and dying, and just the “new” normal for now.  Art has always been a release for me and I have needed it more than ever right now.  It is strange to be working on a subject that I am also trying to escape from and so even in creating the art I have moments of being in the flow state and then also realizing why I am creating certain pieces.  In the end, it is also not only an escape for me, but I hope it helps other people escape or maybe make sense of things.</p>

            <h3>The Fear of Losing Loved Ones</h3>
            <p>Covid hasn’t hit us yet. We are in the states. My wife doesn’t really want to admit it. I think she is too scared to think about what could happen. It’s time to really move to social isolation. Social distance isn’t enough. I think it is fair to say there is a viral tsunami on the way. Please be clean and keep your distance, for all of our sakes.</p>
            <p>In our family we have 6 parents who are above the age of 70. The majority have suffered in health for the past few years. We are very concerned that, while we have been lucky thus far, we may soon lose at least one: if not all.</p>

            <h3>We Gave Up On Getting Tested and Self-Quarantined</h3>
            <img src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.197/rhd.1d2.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Medical-Lab.jpg">
            <p>My husband came home last week extremely sick and with symptoms presenting like COVID-19 (tight chest, trouble breathing, cough, body aches, fever, headache). He had been on a train with a conductor who coughed for 11 hours. The trains run between Utah and Washington but change crew every few (11-12) hours. We were concerned that he could contract it because the trains are like a germ box. He developed symptoms in two days, starting with tightness in his chest and no runny nose.</p>
            <p>We immediately set up space for him in the basement and started calling hospitals and the health department. They would not test him for anything but the flu and said to come in if his fever got over 102. He never got over 102. Our 19 year old wore a filtered mask and goggles and gloves to help him. We sprayed every surface with Bleach and Lysol. We washed our hands. Still it spread.</p>
            <p>Our 19 yr old and I developed symptoms in two days. However, our 11 year old only was very asymptomatic and only sneezed a few times. When (19) woke with a fever of 102 we took him to the doctor and they did a rapid flu test that came back negative. They still wouldn’t test him. I called the health department and was told we do not have it in our state and they will only test the at risk…. We were angry and confused. That evening they announced the first Idaho case with four to follow the next day. (all at risk patients, over 50 or traveled outside the state.) We were informed that there are only so many tests. Our state has only tested 275 people and still are not reporting cases even with two community spread cases. They continue to say we’re a low risk state. However there are dozens reporting symptoms who cannot get tested.</p>
